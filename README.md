# Retail_Store_Sales
This is an SQL Project that focuses on data cleaning. I use ETL so that I finally analse and make reports wih the data.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

- **Dataset Link:** [Retail Store Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/retail-store-sales-dirty-for-data-cleaning)

**About the Data**


The Dirty Retail Store Sales dataset contains 12,575 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions from a retail store. The dataset includes eight product categories with 25 items per category, each having static prices. It is designed to simulate real-world sales data, including intentional "dirtiness" such as missing or inconsistent values. This dataset is suitable for practicing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.
